## Discovering Nuxt

After rebuilding this site [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev) from scratch up with Vue [last year](/blog/hello-world-vernaillen-dev), for which I spend a lot of time selecting and integrating different vue and vite plugins, I decided to build my other website, [Harmonics.be](https://harmonics.be) and [links.vernaillen.dev](https://links.vernaillen.dev) with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/).

Nuxt makes it a lot easier and faster to bootstrap a new website. Less fiddling with plugins to make it all work nicely together. And it's bundled with Vite and running on Nitro's server engine, so it's pretty fast. I also love writing and publishing content with Markdown, therefor [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) is just perfect for me for content management.

*Edit: A month has past since I've first published this blog post, but since then I've also created a new website using Nuxt for my sister [Anneleen Vernaillen](https://www.anneleenvernaillen.com/), and today (March 2) I've put the Nuxt version of [this website](https://vernaillen.dev).*

## Deployed on Vercel

At this moment I have deployed 6 websites using Nuxt on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/):

- [anneleenvernaillen.com](https://anneleenvernaillen.com) my sister, Anneleen Vernaillen's new website. All design and art work by her, web development by me
- [harmonics.be](https://harmonics.be) my website for my activities as a sound healing practicioner, ecstatic dance dj and trance dance facilitator
- [vernaillen.dev](https://harmonics.be) this website, my freelance developer website
- [links.vernaillen.dev](https://links.vernaillen.dev) my "link in bio" app
- [nuxt-audiomotion-analyzer-docs](https://nuxt-audiomotion-analyzer-docs.vercel.app/) Nuxt AudioMotion Analyzer, a Vite plugin I made wrapping [Henrique Vianna's audioMotion-analyzer](https://audiomotion.dev/#/)
- [nuxt-audiomotion-analyzer.vercel.app](https://nuxt-audiomotion-analyzer.vercel.app/) a small demo site for the Vue AudioMotion Analyzer

## The stack I'm using

- [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) as web framework
- it's abviously based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as JavaScript framework
- [Nuxt Content 2](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) for managing content with markdown
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as CSS framework
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for e2e testing
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as fast package manager
- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) for automating dependency updates
- [GitHub](https://github.com/vernaillen) as code repository
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) for 'bringing it all together' and hosting the apps
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing

## The learning never stops

For learning everything about Nuxt I decided to purchase the [Mastering Nuxt 3](https://masteringnuxt.com/) video course, which is created by the team who created Nuxt 3. I didn't regret that purchase and I can highly recommed it.

Currently I'm learning how to build and secure serverside api's with Nuxt.
