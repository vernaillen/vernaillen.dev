## What is Kaspa?

Kaspa is a new kind of cryptocurrency that improves on the original design of Bitcoin. It aims to stay true to Satoshi Nakamoto's vision—a fast, decentralized, and secure digital money system—but with modern upgrades that fix some of Bitcoin's limitations.

## The Technology Behind Kaspa

Most cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, use something called a blockchain: a long, single chain of blocks that are added one after another. Only one block can be added at a time, which can slow things down.

Kaspa uses a different approach called a "blockDAG." Instead of just one chain, blockDAG allows many blocks to be added at the same time and connects them in a network (a Directed Acyclic Graph).
Think of it like a web of blocks instead of a single chain.

Unlike Bitcoin's strictly linear sequence, Kaspa's blocks are added concurrently in parallel threads that merge later. This parallelization significantly enhances throughput while maintaining security. The GHOSTDAG protocol ensures finality by intelligently ordering any conflicting blocks in the DAG to maintain consensus—it picks the best path through this network of blocks to keep everything in order.

Note: Further research such as DagKnight is being explored by the community as a potential future protocol enhancement, though it hasn't been officially confirmed as an upgrade yet.

## Why Is Kaspa a Better Version of Satoshi's Vision?

| Bitcoin                    | Kaspa                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| One block every 10 minutes | Currently ~1 block per second, with 10–32 BPS targeted in future upgrades |
| One chain at a time        | Multiple blocks in parallel via blockDAG   |
| Slow and costly to scale   | Fast, scalable, and efficient              |
| Simple design, but limited | Still simple, but more advanced and faster |

*Note: The Crescendo hardfork (May 2025) focused on protocol optimizations including introspection opcodes (KIP-10) that form the foundation for future smart contract capabilities. Block rate upgrades are separate and planned for future releases—the architecture supports much higher rates (10–32 BPS and beyond).*

Kaspa sticks to the original values of:
* No central authority
* Open participation (anyone can mine)
* Transparent, fair rules

…but adds the speed, scalability, and flexibility needed for real-world use.

## Why I'm So Interested in Kaspa

As a developer who values decentralization and open-source principles, Kaspa caught my attention for several reasons:

**Staying True to Principles**: Unlike many newer cryptocurrencies that sacrifice decentralization for speed, Kaspa maintains proof-of-work mining. While ASICs now dominate the network hashrate (making GPU mining mainly a hobbyist pursuit), Kaspa's fast block rate does slightly reduce orphan risk for smaller miners—though this doesn't meaningfully counterbalance ASIC dominance, and mining remains economically optimized for ASIC hardware. Importantly: no pre-mines, no venture capital controlling the supply, no central authority.

**Technical Innovation**: The blockDAG approach is elegant. Instead of artificially limiting throughput to maintain security (like Bitcoin does), Kaspa's architecture allows parallel block creation while maintaining consensus. As someone who works with distributed systems, I appreciate the engineering behind this.

**Active Development**: The Kaspa core developers have been steadily working on improving the protocol, with exciting developments like smart contracts on the horizon. The community is passionate and the technology is solid.

**vProgs: A Promising Vision**: What excites me most is vProgs—Kaspa's vision for native smart contracts with off-chain execution and on-chain verification using zero-knowledge proofs. This approach could fundamentally change how we think about blockchain programmability. However, it's important to note that vProgs are still in development (testnet targeted for Q4 2025), so while the concept is innovative, real-world implementation and performance remain to be proven.

For now I have decided to start learning smart contract development and EVM programming, so I'll be ready to build on vProgs once it's available for testing.


## Smart Contracts on Kaspa: Multiple Paths Forward

Kaspa started as a pure currency focused on fast, secure transactions. The ecosystem is now expanding with [multiple complementary approaches to programmability](https://kaspa.org/kaspas-programmability-mosaic/), each serving different needs along an evolutionary path:

**Classical L2s → Based L2s (Kasplex/Igra) → Proto-vProgs → Full vProgs**

Today's "based rollups" rely on Kaspa L1 for transaction sequencing while handling execution on L2:

- **[Kasplex](https://medium.com/@KaspaKEF/kasplex-l2-a-light-weight-based-rollup-solution-on-kaspa-33a5939bdf61)**: Kaspa's Ethereum-compatible L2 (zkEVM-style), with [KRC-20](https://docs.kasplex.org/) live today and full smart-contract support rolling out. Bridged KAS serves as the gas token. A [LUA VM with App Store model](https://www.kasbun.com/smart-contracts-are-coming-to-kaspa-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-kasplex-l2-launch) is targeted for December 2025.
- **[Igra Labs](https://kaspa.org/kaspas-programmability-mosaic/) (Testnet)**: EVM-compatible ZK rollup targeting 3,000+ TPS with sub-second finality. Testnet "Caravel" launched July 2025 with 20+ projects/builders contributing. [Roadmap targets](https://igralabs.com/): mainnet early 2026, multi-VM (Move, WASM) Q2 2026.
- **[Sparkle / early Layer 1.5 concepts](https://woolypooly.com/en/blog/kaspa-smart-contracts) (Conceptual)**: An earlier L1.5 smart-contract framework concept, not an active product today.

These are stepping stones—"proto-vProgs"—that will [evolve into full vProgs](https://kaspa.org/kaspas-programmability-mosaic/) as the technology matures. The long-term vision is [vProgs](https://bsc.news/post/kaspa-kas-vprogs) (covered in detail below)—Kaspa's native approach built directly into L1 semantics, offering synchronous composability without liquidity fragmentation.

This positions Kaspa to offer [fast smart contracts](https://captainaltcoin.com/why-kaspa-might-soon-power-the-fastest-smart-contracts-in-crypto/) that are both performant and truly decentralized.

## vProgs: Kaspa's Vision for Scalable Smart Contracts

vProgs (Verifiable Programs) represent Kaspa's long-term vision for programmability—a unique approach to executing complex logic while maintaining speed and decentralization.

### What Makes vProgs Different?

Most blockchain platforms force you to choose: run smart contracts on-chain (slow and expensive) or move them to separate L2 chains (faster but fragments liquidity).

vProgs take a third path: **off-chain execution with on-chain verification**. Instead of making everyone re-execute your smart contract, vProgs execute off-chain and prove correctness using zero-knowledge proofs. The Kaspa blockchain only verifies the proof, not the computation itself.

### How vProgs Work

Think of vProgs like apps on your phone. Each app ([vProg](https://bsc.news/post/kaspa-kas-vprogs)) runs independently but can share data with other apps when needed.

The magic happens through **zero-knowledge proofs** - a way to prove "I did this calculation correctly" without making everyone else redo the work. It's like a teacher checking your math answer without recalculating it themselves.

**Example**: Swapping KAS for a stablecoin might involve three vProgs working together:
1. A **price oracle** checks the current rate
2. A **trading app** handles the swap
3. A **stablecoin app** manages the token

All three run separately, generate their proofs, then combine them into one transaction on Kaspa. If any part fails, everything fails. If all succeed, it all settles instantly - no waiting, no fragmented money spread across different systems.

### Key Benefits

Based on [analysis from BSC News](https://bsc.news/post/kaspa-kas-vprogs):

- **Fast & cheap**: The main blockchain only verifies proofs, not the actual computations
- **Apps work together**: Multiple vProgs can interact in a single transaction (unlike most Layer 2 solutions where apps are isolated)
- **Independent but connected**: Each vProg controls its own data, yet can still seamlessly work with others
- **Spam protection**: A fee system called "ScopeGas" prevents abuse while keeping costs low

### What Can You Build with vProgs?

**DeFi Applications**
- Complex multi-pool trading with atomic cross-pool swaps
- Shared liquidity routing across multiple protocols
- Lending and borrowing in a single atomic transaction
- Privacy-preserving DeFi using ZK proofs

**Payment Systems**
- Micropayments leveraging Kaspa's fast confirmation times
- Enterprise payment settlement
- Conditional payments with programmable logic

**Privacy Applications**
- Encrypted state in applications
- Confidential transactions
- Private oracles and data feeds

**General Applications**
From micropayments to enterprise data settlement, vProgs can support a wide range of use cases by anchoring verifiable outputs to Kaspa's fast blockDAG.

### How vProgs Compare to Other Platforms

**vs. Ethereum Smart Contracts**

| Ethereum | vProgs |
|----------|--------|
| Smart contracts execute on L1 | Execution happens off-chain, verification on-chain via ZK proofs |
| ~15–20 TPS on L1 (varies by tx type/gas) | Theoretical high throughput (potentially several thousand TPS) depending on future block-rate upgrades and ZK verification performance—exact numbers remain speculative |
| High gas fees during congestion | Efficient verification, lower costs |
| L2 rollups fragment liquidity | Synchronous composability unifies liquidity (though L2 fragmentation may be mitigated by shared sequencing in future) |
| Proof of Stake (since "The Merge" in 2022) | Proof of Work (decentralized mining) |

*Note: Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake with "The Merge" in September 2022. While PoS offers energy efficiency benefits, PoW proponents argue it provides stronger decentralization guarantees.*

**vs. Solana Programs**

| Solana | vProgs |
|--------|--------|
| Unified execution on L1 | Sovereign programs with off-chain execution |
| Can lead to network overload | Scales through parallel off-chain execution |
| Requires high-performance validator hardware (clients can run on normal devices) | Maintains decentralization with lower hardware requirements |
| Single state machine | Multiple sovereign state machines with composability |

**The vProgs Advantage:**
1. **No liquidity fragmentation** - Unlike classical L2 rollups, vProgs are [integrated into L1 semantics](https://kaspa.org/kaspas-programmability-mosaic/)
2. **Maintains decentralization** - Proof-of-work base layer with anyone-can-mine ethos
3. **True atomic composability** - Multiple apps interact in single transactions (note: composability depends on "shared state declarations"—vProgs are sovereign programs with isolated state, except where developers explicitly opt into shared scope)
4. **Scalability without centralization** - Off-chain execution with on-chain security

### Current Status and Timeline

**September 11, 2025**: Kaspa released the first draft of the [vProgs Yellow Paper](https://github.com/kaspanet/research/blob/main/vProgs/vProgs_yellow_paper.pdf) (Draft v0.0.1), detailing the technical specification. Community discussion is ongoing in the [Kaspa Research Forum](https://research.kas.pa/t/concrete-proposal-for-a-synchronously-composable-verifiable-programs-architecture/387).

**Foundation Work**: The [Crescendo Hardfork](https://www.kasbun.com/smart-contracts-are-coming-to-kaspa-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-kasplex-l2-launch) (May 5, 2025) activated KIP-10, introducing introspection opcodes (covenants) that form the foundation for vProgs.

**Roadmap targets** (per [community discussions](https://bsc.news/post/kaspa-latest-news-november-2025) as of late 2025):
- **December 2025**: Roadmap and support plans for L1 zkopcode & vProgs (enabling on-chain ZK verification in later upgrades)
- **Q4 2025**: vProgs testnet
- **Mainnet**: Depends on auditing and performance benchmarks

*Timeline disclaimer: As with any evolving blockchain project, these dates are targets and may shift based on development progress, testing results, and audit findings. Delays in the crypto space are common, so it's wise to follow official announcements for the most up-to-date information.*

**Still in development**: Account creation, pruning rules, publication protocols, developer tools, and testing frameworks.

### Why This Matters for Developers

As a developer, what excites me about vProgs is that they represent a fundamentally different approach to blockchain scalability. Instead of choosing between:
- Decentralization (Bitcoin)
- Speed (centralized chains)
- Smart contracts (Ethereum with high fees)

...vProgs aim to deliver all three by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and Kaspa's unique blockDAG architecture.

The vision is ambitious: native, verifiable, bridge-free contracts on a proof-of-work Layer 1, with the speed and composability of modern platforms, but without sacrificing the decentralization principles that make blockchain technology valuable in the first place.

- Enhanced developer tools

**Long-term:**
- Becoming a viable alternative to both Bitcoin (as a store of value) and Ethereum (as a smart contract platform)
- Proving that you don't have to sacrifice decentralization for speed

The technology is sound, the community is growing, and the principles are right. Whether Kaspa succeeds in its ambitious goals remains to be seen, but it's certainly a project worth watching.

## In Summary

Kaspa is like Bitcoin 2.0—it keeps the heart of the idea but upgrades the engine to handle today's demands. It's faster, fairer, and built for the future of digital money, while staying true to the principles that started it all.

What excites me most is that Kaspa proves you don't have to choose between decentralization, security, and speed. With the right architecture (blockDAG + GHOSTDAG), you can have all three.
