## Kaspa At a Glance

Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that stays true to Satoshi Nakamoto's vision—decentralized, secure digital money—while fixing Bitcoin's speed limitations. 

It uses blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of a traditional blockchain, allowing multiple blocks to be created in parallel (~10 blocks per second) while maintaining decentralization. 

The ecosystem is expanding with L2 solutions (Kasplex, Igra) today and a longer-term vision called vProgs for native smart contracts using zero-knowledge proofs.

## What is Kaspa?

Kaspa aims to realize Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of fast, decentralized, secure digital money—but with modern upgrades. 

It improves on Bitcoin's original design by replacing the single-chain blockchain with a "blockDAG." Instead of adding blocks one at a time, blockDAG allows many blocks to be created simultaneously and connects them in a network (Directed Acyclic Graph). 

The GHOSTDAG protocol orders any conflicting blocks to maintain consensus.

| Traditional Blockchain | Kaspa's BlockDAG |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| One block every 10 minutes (Bitcoin) | ~10 blocks per second (post-Crescendo) |
| Sequential block creation | Parallel block creation |
| Limited throughput | Higher throughput potential |

*Note: The Crescendo hardfork (May 5, 2025) upgraded the network from 1 BPS to 10 BPS. Higher rates (~32 BPS) are longer-term targets.*

Kaspa maintains proof-of-work mining with no pre-mine and no central authority—though ASICs now dominate the network hashrate, making GPU mining mainly a hobbyist pursuit.

## Why I'm Interested

As a developer who values open-source principles, Kaspa caught my attention because:

- **Technical approach**: The blockDAG architecture is an elegant solution to the throughput vs. decentralization tradeoff
- **Active development**: The core team has been steadily improving the protocol, with smart contract capabilities on the horizon
- **vProgs vision**: Native smart contracts with off-chain execution and on-chain verification using zero-knowledge proofs (more on this below)

I've started learning smart contract development and EVM programming to be ready when these capabilities become available.

## Smart Contracts: Current and Future

Kaspa started as a pure currency. The ecosystem is now expanding with [multiple approaches to programmability](https://kaspa.org/kaspas-programmability-mosaic/):

**Available Today:**
- **[KRC-20](https://docs.kasplex.org/)**: Token standard using L1 data insertion and off-chain indexing

**In Development:**
- **[Kasplex L2](https://medium.com/@KaspaKEF/kasplex-l2-a-light-weight-based-rollup-solution-on-kaspa-33a5939bdf61)**: Planned Ethereum-compatible L2 with LUA VM targeted for December 2025
- **[Igra Labs](https://igralabs.com/)**: EVM-compatible ZK rollup (testnet live, mainnet targeted early 2026)

**Long-term Vision:**
- **vProgs**: Native smart contracts built into L1 (see below)

## vProgs: Off-Chain Execution, On-Chain Verification

vProgs (Verifiable Programs) represent Kaspa's long-term approach to smart contracts. The key idea: instead of executing contracts on-chain (slow and expensive) or on separate L2s (fragments liquidity), vProgs execute off-chain and prove correctness using zero-knowledge proofs. The blockchain only verifies the proof.

**How it works**: Think of vProgs like apps that run independently but can interact when needed. A token swap might involve three vProgs—a price oracle, trading app, and stablecoin manager—each generating proofs that combine into one atomic transaction.

**Claimed benefits** (per [BSC News analysis](https://bsc.news/post/kaspa-kas-vprogs)):
- Efficient verification instead of full re-execution
- Multiple vProgs can interact in single transactions
- "ScopeGas" fee system for spam protection

**Current status**: The [vProgs Yellow Paper](https://github.com/kaspanet/research/blob/main/vProgs/vProgs_yellow_paper.pdf) (Draft v0.0.1) was released September 2025. This is early-stage research—timelines are speculative and depend on development progress, testing, and audits.
