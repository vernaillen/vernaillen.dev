        description: Wouter is a dedicated professional with who I had the pleasure to
          work with on two strategic projects at Van Marcke. He was the go to IT
          professional and project leader on both the new intranet and the roll out of
          an enterprise wide search engine and social media collaboration platform.
          Wouter is also a great colleague to work with and a strong team player and
          leader. I would recommend him without hesitation.

        description: Ik had het genoegen samen met Wouter te werken op het IDEWE
          IT-project Klantenportaal. Vooral de aangename, rustige manier van overleggen
          van Wouter is een pluspunt binnen de hectiek van deadlines en onverwachte
          issues en bugs. Daarnaast beschikt Wouter over een scherp analytisch vermogen
          en kan hij problemen/oplossingen in begrijpbare taal overbrengen naar de rest
          van het team (wat ook uit niet-software people bestaat). Wouter levert correct
          op wat van hem gevraagd word en hij denkt zelf na over mogelijke alternieven
          van eerder gedefinieerde oplossingen. Ik kijk al uit naar de volgende
          samenwerking!
