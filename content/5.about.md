## Passions

I'm an avid traveler, always open to learn from other cultures and intrigued by cross-cultural movements and tribes.

[Sound, music & dance](https://harmonics.be){target=_blank} is one of my passions, as I find it the best way to translate, give and recieve energy. 
Besides being a developer I'm also a sound healing practicioner, ecstatic dance dj and trance dance facilitator. You can find more about these activities on my other website [Harmonics.be](https://harmonics.be).

## Career

My career as an IT consultant started in 1999. The first 14 years I worked as an employee for several IT service companies, and since 2013 I'm working as a freelancer.

By now I have build up more then 25 years of experience in web development and full stack development.

I have strongly specialised in full stack java development on portal platforms. Since 2006 this was focussed on IBM WebSphere Portal, while working for IBM.

In 2013 I decided to start freelancing, and changed my focus to open source platform, like [Liferay Portal](https://www.liferay.com/).

The last few years I got excited about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and I have build or migrated several websites with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). You can read more about that in this [blog post about Nuxt 3](/blog/nuxt)

You can find a detailed overview of the clients and technologies I've worked with on my [career page](/career).
