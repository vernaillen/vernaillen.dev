    - quote: Ik had het genoegen samen met Wouter te werken op het IDEWE IT-project Klantenportaal. Vooral de aangename, rustige manier van overleggen van Wouter is een pluspunt binnen de hectiek van deadlines en onverwachte issues en bugs. Daarnaast beschikt Wouter over een scherp analytisch vermogen en kan hij problemen/oplossingen in begrijpbare taal overbrengen naar de rest van het team (wat ook uit niet-software people bestaat). Wouter levert correct op wat van hem gevraagd word en hij denkt zelf na over mogelijke alternieven van eerder gedefinieerde oplossingen. Ik kijk al uit naar de volgende samenwerking!

    - quote: Wouter is a dedicated professional with who I had the pleasure to work with on two strategic projects at Van Marcke. He was the go to IT professional and project leader on both the new intranet and the roll out of an enterprise wide search engine and social media collaboration platform. Wouter is also a great colleague to work with and a strong team player and leader. I would recommend him without hesitation.
